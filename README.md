# FixTextPath
Adobe Illustrator versions prior to 23.0.5 do not support TextOnPath for SVGs at the moment. This script fixes TextOnPath for those older versions when opening SVGs.

How to install it:
Copy to the script to the adobe directory on your PC.

### Windows:
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2019\Presets\en_US\Scripts

### Mac:
Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC/Presets/en_GB/Scripts

The file path may differ depending on your version of Illustrator (could be CS6 instead of CC, for example), and also your language (could be ja_JP instead of en_GB, for example). You might need to rename it to jsx to make it work.
