# FixTextPath
Repo to host the script for fixing text on paths when opening an svg in Adobe Illustrator

Installation:

### Windows:
copy the script to the Presets\en_US\Scripts subfolder of the adobe installation folder 
(you probably have to rename it to jsx to work)

### Mac:
Navigate to Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC/Presets/en_GB/Scripts
and copy the .js or .jsx files there.

The file path may differ depending on your version of Illustrator (could be CS6 instead of CC, for example), and also your language (could be ja_JP instead of en_GB, for example).
