# FixTextPath
Adobe Illustrator does not support TextOnPath for SVGs at the moment. While they are picking up this issue, this script fixes TextOnPath when opening SVGs.

# GroupsToLayer
When importing SVG's in Adobe Illustrator, it currently treats creates a group for each node. This script converts all top level groups to layers.

# How to install a script:
Copy to the script to the Adobe directory on your machine.

### Windows:
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2019\Presets\en_US\Scripts

### Mac:
Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC/Presets/en_GB/Scripts

The file path may differ depending on your version of Illustrator (could be CS6 instead of CC, for example), and also your language (could be ja_JP instead of en_GB, for example). You might need to rename it to jsx to make it work.
